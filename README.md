# About

I created this website for a family member to use in their store (it is not in the public domain, only employees would use it). It is connected to a database created with mongoDb. It's really simple because the focus is just registering the cards to have control.

# Packages and tip:

**Packages to install:**

To be able to connect the server in a way that is easier for the user, generate an executable like this:

**Tip:**
 
   I transformed the website into an executable using the pkg package, so the client just needs to click on the executable and that's it, the server will be running on the local machine and will open the website.
